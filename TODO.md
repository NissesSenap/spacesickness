## TODO NOW
 * Dependency handling when adding new packages.
 * Create package structure in json like {"name": "pkg-1.0.rpm", "path": "/tmp/rpms/pkg-1.0.rpm"}
 * Create webapi and rpm file servering.
 * Check createrepo_c and see if we can build something fun with that, look at examples/python/simple_createrepo.py
 * 

## TODO LATER
 * Build abstraction layer between different package types so we can add support for RPM, DEB and PKG with a unified front
 * Move all rpm files to s3 storage, create a proxy util for fetching and deploying there.
